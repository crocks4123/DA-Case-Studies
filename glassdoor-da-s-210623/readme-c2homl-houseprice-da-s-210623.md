# House Price Prediction Project

![House Price Prediction](house_price_prediction.jpg)

## Overview

This repository contains the "House Price Prediction" project, which focuses on predicting house prices based on various property features. The project was undertaken as part of the "Data Analytics Case Studies" series (c2homl-houseprice-da-s-210623) to explore data analytics techniques and gain insights into the real estate market.

## Project Description

In this project, we aim to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict house prices based on features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and more. The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from a reputable real estate data provider and contains a wide range of residential property information.

The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection to create an effective predictive model. Through this project, we seek to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing house prices and create a useful tool for potential homebuyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for analysis. (Note: The actual dataset is not included in this repository for privacy reasons.)
- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- `models/`: This directory stores trained machine learning models for house price prediction.
- `utils/`: This directory contains utility functions and scripts used throughout the project.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and usage instructions.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project was obtained from [Real Estate Data Providers, Inc.](https://www.realestatedataproviders.com). Due to licensing restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository. However, interested parties can request access from the data provider to reproduce the analysis.

## Project Details

To reproduce the analysis, you will need Python 3.x, along with the following libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage

To explore the project and reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the required Python environment using the dependencies listed above.
3. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and run the Jupyter notebooks in the specified order for data preprocessing and model training.
4. Review the results, visualizations, and model evaluations in the notebooks.

## Contributing

As part of the "Data Analytics Case Studies" series, contributions to this project are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the analysis, adding new features, or addressing issues, feel free to submit pull requests.

## Acknowledgments

We express our gratitude to [Real Estate Data Providers, Inc.](https://www.realestatedataproviders.com) for providing the dataset, enabling us to conduct this analysis.
