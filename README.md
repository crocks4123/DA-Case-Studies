# Data Analytics Projects

This repository contains various data analytics projects that I have undertaken for fun and learning purposes. I enjoy exploring different datasets, performing analysis, and deriving insights. I will continue to add more projects to this repository in the future. Currently, the projects available are:

## 1. Amazon Basic Sales Analysis 2019 (da-s-310523)

The project titled "Amazon Basic Sales Analysis 2019" explores a dataset related to the sales of Amazon Basic products in the year 2019. The analysis includes various aspects such as sales trends, product performance, customer reviews, and more. This project provides valuable insights into the performance and popularity of Amazon Basic products in the given year.

## 2. DS Job Glassdoor Analysis (glassdoor-da-s-210623)

The project titled "DS Job Glassdoor Analysis" focuses on the analysis of a dataset obtained from Glassdoor containing data science job postings. The analysis involves cleaning the dataset, exploring job titles and companies, examining job locations, analyzing salary trends, and identifying the required skills and qualifications for data science jobs. This project provides insights into the data science job market, helping job seekers and researchers understand the industry better.

I primarily used Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and Google Colab for developing and running these projects. VSCode provided a versatile environment for coding, while Google Colab allowed me to leverage its powerful computing resources and collaborative features for more intensive analyses.

## 3. House Price Prediction (Hands-On ML, Ch. 2)

The "House Price Prediction" project is inspired by the second chapter of "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron. Using Python and popular libraries like Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib, I analyzed a dataset with residential property features to predict house prices. This case study honed my regression analysis and model evaluation skills. I share this project to inspire others in the exciting world of data analytics and predictive modeling.

**Acknowledgments:** Special thanks to Aurélien Géron for the invaluable guidance from the book, and to the dataset creators for providing the data for real-world application.

Feel free to explore the code and insights from this house price prediction project for your own learning and data exploration. Enjoy the journey of data analytics!


## Usage

To explore any of the projects mentioned above, you can navigate to the respective project folder in this repository. Each project folder contains the necessary files, including datasets, code, and documentation, to reproduce the analysis and derive insights from the data.

Feel free to use the code, datasets, and insights provided in these projects for educational, research, or exploratory purposes. I hope these projects serve as examples and inspiration for your own data analytics endeavors.

## Contributing

As I continue to work on new projects and expand this repository, I welcome contributions from the community. If you have ideas for new projects, improvements to existing projects, or any suggestions, please feel free to submit pull requests or reach out to discuss your ideas.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the data sources, including Amazon and Glassdoor, for providing the datasets used in these projects. Without their valuable data, these analyses would not have been possible.

## Contact

If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback regarding any of the projects or this repository in general, please feel free to reach out. You can contact me through the contact information provided in the project folders or the repository's main page.
