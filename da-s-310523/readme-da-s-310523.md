# Data Analytics Case Studies

Welcome to the **Data Analytics Case Studies** repository! This repository contains a collection of mini case studies that demonstrate various data analytics techniques and methodologies. Each case study is solved using Google Colab and Python, providing an interactive and reproducible environment for analysis.

## Case Studies

### da-s-310523: Amazon Sales Data Analysis (2019)

The first case study in this repository is **da-s-310523**, which focuses on analyzing Amazon sales data from the year 2019. In this analysis, we explore the sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance using data analytics techniques.

The analysis covers the following key aspects:

- **Data cleaning and preprocessing**: The raw data is cleaned and prepared for analysis. Missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies are addressed to ensure the quality of the dataset.
- **Exploratory data analysis**: Various visualizations and statistical summaries are used to gain insights into the sales data. We examine sales patterns, seasonal trends, and the distribution of key variables.
- **Determining the perfect advertisement time period**: We analyze the sales data to identify the time period during which advertisements are most effective. This helps in optimizing marketing strategies and maximizing sales.
- **Identifying the best city in terms of sales**: We investigate the sales data to determine which city contributes the most to overall sales. This analysis helps in targeting specific regions for business expansion and marketing efforts.
- **Determining factors behind the success of the most selling product**: By analyzing the attributes of the most selling product, we aim to identify the reasons behind its popularity. This provides insights into product features, customer preferences, and marketing strategies.
